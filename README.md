</h1>

Gamelist is a personal game backlog, preorder, price, trophy, achievement, and physical collection tracker. It runs as a self-hosted static frontend served by a Cloudflare Worker, with saved data stored in Cloudflare KV.

The app has two connected pages:

- <img src="assets/Icon.png" alt="Gamelist" width="18" align="center"> `/` for the main game backlog, preorder, release, and completion status tracker.
- <img src="assets/Icon_shelf.png" alt="Shelf" width="18" align="center"> `/shelf` for the physical collection tracker and organizer.

Pull down the top bar/handle to go to the other page!

Both pages share edit mode, themes, account settings, price-store settings, achievement integrations. Shelf Sync can also send physical collection additions back into the main Gamelist flow and in reverse when you add a new game to your backlog.

  <img src="assets/Icon.png" alt="Gamelist logo" width="42" align="center">
  <span style="color: #e92841;">How To Setup Your Own Gamelist</span>
</h1>

This is the main setup path. You do not need to download a ZIP or run terminal commands. Cloudflare can import the public GitHub repository URL directly from the dashboard and automatically setup your own personal copy for you, for free.

#### Setup requirements

- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/cloudflare/F38020" alt="Cloudflare" width="18" align="center"> A Cloudflare account, to host your site.
- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/github/D0D7DE" alt="GitHub" width="18" align="center"> A GitHub account to host your site files.
- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/twitch/9146FF" alt="Twitch" width="18" align="center"> A Twitch account to access the IGDB api and get all the game data.

The setup is simple, it will take you under an hour to fully set up with the required steps. If you want to also have all the extras, it will be just under 2 hours total to fully set up the rest. But, then adding your games is a whole other story... Enjoy keeping track of your games, plan your next playthroughs, and more than anything, enjoy the hobby!

Your default Gamelist site url will be **gamelist.\***email_username**\*.workers.dev** You can change it later with a custom domain if wanted.

### 1. Start from Cloudflare

1. Open the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Click **Create application**.
4. Click **Continue with GitHub**.
5. Choose **Import a repository**.
6. Choose **Clone a public repository via GitHub URL**.
7. Add this repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/ShabiiEXE/Gamelist
```

8. Continue with the imported repository.
9. If Cloudflare sends you to GitHub, set up or sign in to your GitHub account and allow the connection.
10. Keep the default settings and click **Deploy**.
11. Once deployed, open **Overview** in the nav bar and click **Visit** to open your site.
12. If the **Visit** button is not available, open **Domains** in the nav bar and enable both URLs.
13. After your site opens, continue to **Automatic Updates** below if you want to add update sync.

### 2. Set your password to access settings (Adding Secrets in Cloudflare)

In the Worker project settings, add your secrets through the Cloudflare website:

1. Open the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Open your Gamelist Worker.
4. Open **Settings**.
5. Open **Variables and Secrets**.
6. Click **Add**.
7. Choose **Secret** for passwords, API keys, and tokens.
8. Enter the variable name exactly as shown below.
9. Paste the value.
10. Deploy/Save.

Add this required secret first:

```text
EDIT_PASSWORD
```

`EDIT_PASSWORD` is the password you will type in the app to unlock edit mode and change your site settings and theme.

Use **Secret** for all integration keys/tokens. Do not put them in `wrangler.toml`, do not commit them to GitHub, and do not share them publicly.

Now **continue** the setup until you reach **Recommended Integrations**. The next integrations are **required** to make it all work properly, but the recommended ones will help you improve your experience a bit more.

### 3. Add game search and auto-fill

Game lookup requires integrating with IGDB.
IGDB authentication uses Twitch developer credentials:

1. Open the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).
2. Log in with a Twitch account.
3. Make sure the account has email verification and 2FA enabled.
4. Go to **Applications**.
5. Click **Register Your Application**.
6. Use any app name, for example `Gamelist`.
7. Use `https://localhost` as the OAuth Redirect URL.
8. Set the category to **Website Integration**.
9. Set client type as **Confidential**.
10. Create the app.
11. Click the manage button on the Application you just created.
12. Copy the **Client ID** and create a new **Cloudflare secret**:

```text
IGDB_CLIENT_ID
```

11. Click generate new secret and copy the **Client Secret** and create another **Cloudflare secret**:

```text
IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 4. Set up the automatic website updates/patches

To receive upcoming Gamelist feature updates, add the GitHub Actions sync workflow to your repository.

1. Once the setup is done, go to your newly added GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Click **set up a workflow yourself**.
4. Make sure the default file name is:

```text
main.yml
```

5. Then open this link [main.yml](https://github.com/ShabiiEXE/Gamelist/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) to the workflow action file from the main Gamelist repository.
6. Copy the code from that file using to copy button on the top right or manually select all and copy.
7. Paste it into the empty workflow text box.
8. Commit the changes.
9. Go back to **Actions**.
10. Open **Sync from upstream**.
11. Enable the workflow if GitHub asks.
12. Click **Run workflow** once to test it.

To force an update manually later, open your repository, go to **Actions**, open **Sync from upstream**, and click **Run workflow**.
For now, let's finish this setup.

13. Go back to your repository **Code page** (Main page) and next to about press the cog button.
14. Inside the website text box add your website url

15. Open [GitHub fine-grained personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens).
16. Click **Generate new token**.
17. Use a clear name, for example `Gamelist Cloudflare updater`.
18. Under **Resource owner**, choose the GitHub account that owns your Gamelist repository.
19. Set **No expiration** as the expiration date.
20. Under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories**.
21. Select only your Gamelist repository. Do not select any other repositories.
22. Under **Repository permissions**, **Add permissions** and check **Actions** and change it to **Read and write**.
23. Click **Generate token**.
24. Copy the token immediately. GitHub will not show it again.
25. Add it in Cloudflare **Variables and Secrets** as a **Secret**:

```text
GITHUB_WORKFLOW_TOKEN
```

### Twitch stream preview

The Currently Playing carousel can show a Twitch preview card before the games.

To enable it:

1. Enter edit mode.
2. Open **Settings**.
3. Add your Twitch username in the platform/account settings.
4. Mark at least one currently-playing game as **Stream**.
5. Save settings.

When those are both set, Gamelist and Shelf add a Twitch preview as the first carousel item. If the channel is live, it embeds the current stream. If the channel is offline, it tries to show the latest saved stream instead. The card links directly to the configured Twitch channel.
