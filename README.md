# Gamelist

A personal game backlog, preorder, price, trophy, and physical shelf tracker.

The app is a static frontend served by a Cloudflare Worker. Saved data lives in Cloudflare KV, and API routes under `functions/api` handle sync, search, store prices, trophies, achievements, calendar events, and Shelf collection values.

## What You Need

- Node.js 20 or newer
- A Cloudflare account
- Wrangler, Cloudflare's CLI
- One Cloudflare KV namespace bound as `GAMELIST`
- An `EDIT_PASSWORD` Worker secret

Optional integrations can be added with Worker secrets for IGDB, PSN, Steam, Xbox, Google Calendar, and PriceCharting.

## Local Development

Run the local static server:

```bash
node server.mjs
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8790
```

For Worker-style local testing, install/use Wrangler and run:

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

Useful checks before pushing:

```bash
node --check app.js
node --check shelf.js
node --check worker.js
node --check functions/api/prices.js
node --check functions/api/collection-price.js
node --check functions/api/sync.js
node --check functions/api/shelf.js
node --check scripts/test-shelf-sync.mjs
node scripts/test-shelf-sync.mjs
git diff --check
```

## Cloudflare Wrangler Setup

1. Install Wrangler and log in:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

You can also use `npx wrangler ...` without a global install.

2. Create a KV namespace:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create GAMELIST
```

3. Copy the generated namespace id into `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "GAMELIST"
id = "PASTE_THE_NEW_ID_HERE"
```

4. Choose the Worker name in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
name = "my-gamelist"
```

5. Set the required edit password:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put EDIT_PASSWORD
```

6. Deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

The site will be available on the generated `workers.dev` URL unless you attach a custom domain in Cloudflare.

## Required Cloudflare Pieces

`GAMELIST` KV namespace:
Stores saved Gamelist data, Shelf data, layout settings, and synced preferences.

`EDIT_PASSWORD` secret:
Unlocks edit mode and allows saving to KV. Without it, the app can display data but cannot save edits to the cloud.

## Recommended Secret

### PriceCharting Token

Shelf collection values work best with a PriceCharting API token:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PRICECHARTING_TOKEN
```

With this token, saved PriceCharting product IDs can be fetched directly through PriceCharting's product API. Without it, the app falls back to public PriceCharting search/product pages, which can be slower and less reliable during bulk Shelf price updates.

## Optional Integrations

### IGDB Lookup

Game lookup can use IGDB if these secrets are configured:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put IGDB_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

IGDB authentication uses Twitch developer credentials:

1. Open the Twitch Developer Console: `https://dev.twitch.tv/console`
2. Log in with a Twitch account.
3. Make sure the Twitch account has email verification and 2FA enabled.
4. Go to **Applications**.
5. Click **Register Your Application**.
6. Use any name, for example `Gamelist`.
7. Use `http://localhost` as the OAuth Redirect URL. The app only needs server-to-server credentials, but Twitch requires a redirect URL when registering.
8. Set the category to **Website Integration** or the closest available app category.
9. Create the app.
10. Copy the **Client ID** into the `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` Cloudflare secret.
11. Create/copy the app secret into `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

The app requests Twitch app access tokens automatically. Without IGDB credentials, lookup falls back where possible, but results may be weaker.

### PSN Trophy Activity

The trophy widgets use Sony's PSN API through a Cloudflare Worker secret called `PSN_NPSSO`.

1. Log into PlayStation in your browser: `https://www.playstation.com/`
2. In the same browser, open: `https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie`
3. Copy only the long `npsso` token value from the JSON response.
4. Set it as a Cloudflare secret:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PSN_NPSSO
```

You can also set a default PSN profile name:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PSN_PROFILE_USER
```

Treat the NPSSO token like a password. Do not commit it, paste it in chat, or put it in `wrangler.toml`. If trophies stop loading, refresh the token.

### Steam Achievements

PC game overlays can show Steam achievements when these are configured:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put STEAM_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put STEAM_PROFILE_USER
```

Get a Steam Web API key from `https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey`.

Set `STEAM_PROFILE_USER` to a SteamID64, Steam profile URL, or vanity name. The site's Settings overlay also has a **Steam account** field; if filled, it overrides the Cloudflare value for that browser/account. For each PC game, add a Steam store URL or Steam App ID in the game editor.

Steam achievements are only fetched for Steam app IDs owned by the configured Steam account. Make sure the account's game details/library visibility allows Steam Web API access. Legacy games saved with the platform `PC` are treated as `Steam`; use `Xbox PC` for Microsoft Store or PC Game Pass games.

### Xbox Achievements

Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and Xbox PC games can show achievements through OpenXBL. Create a personal API key in the OpenXBL dashboard, then add it as a Cloudflare secret:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENXBL_API_KEY
```

You can optionally set a default gamertag:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put XBOX_GAMERTAG
```

The site's Settings overlay has a **Microsoft account** field that accepts an Xbox gamertag or XUID. When filled, it overrides `XBOX_GAMERTAG`.

### Google Calendar Preorder Events

When a game is newly marked as preordered and has a release date, the Worker can create an all-day Google Calendar event named `Preorder Game Name`.

Set up a Google Cloud service account with Google Calendar API access, then share the target calendar with the service account email with permission to make changes.

Set these Cloudflare secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID
```

`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` can be your calendar ID from Google Calendar settings. The private key should be the `private_key` value from the service account JSON. Do not commit it.

## First Run

1. Deploy the Worker.
2. Open the site.
3. Click edit/login and enter `EDIT_PASSWORD`.
4. Open Settings.
5. Set currency, region, selected shops, default owner, account names, theme, Shelf Sync, and visible sections.
6. Save settings.

Those settings are stored in the Worker KV namespace.

## Data Notes

- Main Gamelist KV key: `gamelist-data`
- Shelf KV key: `shelf-data`
- Cloud sync endpoint: `/api/sync`
- Shelf sync endpoint: `/api/shelf`
- Local browser draft backup: `localStorage`

To start clean, use a brand-new KV namespace. To clone existing data, copy the relevant KV values into the new namespace.
