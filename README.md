</h1>

Gamelist is a personal game backlog, preorder, price, trophy, achievement, and physical shelf tracker. It runs as a static frontend served by a Cloudflare Worker, with saved data stored in Cloudflare KV.

The app has two connected pages:

- <img src="assets/Icon.png" alt="Gamelist" width="18" align="center"> `/` for the main digital backlog, preorder, release, and completion tracker.
- <img src="assets/Icon_shelf.png" alt="Shelf" width="18" align="center"> `/shelf` for the physical collection tracker.

Both pages share edit mode, themes, account settings, price-store settings, achievement integrations, and the same `GAMELIST` KV namespace. Shelf Sync can also send physical collection additions back into the main Gamelist flow.

## Features

- Cloud sync through Cloudflare Workers KV.
- IGDB-powered lookup for covers, release dates, descriptions, genres, developers, publishers, trailers, and store links.
- Backlog, upcoming, available, currently playing, and finished-game boards.
- Release calendar with preorder markers.
- Physical Shelf library with multiple owners, regions, conditions, categories, prices, collection value, and linked Gamelist entries.

<h1>
  <img src="assets/Icon.png" alt="Gamelist logo" width="42" align="center">
  <span style="color: #e92841;">How To Setup Your Own Gamelist</span>
</h1>

This is the main setup path. You do not need to download a ZIP or run terminal commands. Cloudflare can import the public GitHub repository URL directly from the dashboard and automatically setup your own personal copy for you, for free.

#### Setup requirements

- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/cloudflare/F38020" alt="Cloudflare" width="18" align="center"> A Cloudflare account
- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/github/181717" alt="GitHub" width="18" align="center"> A GitHub account
- <img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/twitch/9146FF" alt="Twitch" width="18" align="center"> A Twitch account

### 1. Start from Cloudflare

1. Open the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Click **Create application**.
4. Click **Continue with GitHub**.
5. Choose **Import a repository**.
6. Choose **Clone a public repository via GitHub URL**.
7. Add this repository URL:

```text
https://github.com/ShabiiEXE/Gamelist
```

8. Continue with the imported repository.
9. If Cloudflare sends you to GitHub, set up or sign in to your GitHub account and allow the connection.
10. Keep the default settings and click **Deploy**.
11. Once deployed, open **Overview** in the nav bar and click **Visit** to open your site.
12. If the **Visit** button is not available, open **Domains** in the nav bar and enable both URLs.
13. After your site opens, continue to **Automatic Updates** below if you want to add update sync.

### 2. Set your password to access settings (Adding Secrets in Cloudflare)

In the Worker project settings, add your secrets through the Cloudflare website:

1. Open the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Open your Gamelist Worker.
4. Open **Settings**.
5. Open **Variables and Secrets**.
6. Click **Add**.
7. Choose **Secret** for passwords, API keys, and tokens.
8. Enter the variable name exactly as shown below.
9. Paste the value.
10. Deploy/Save.

Add this required secret first:

```text
EDIT_PASSWORD
```

`EDIT_PASSWORD` is the password you will type in the app to unlock edit mode and change your site settings and theme.

Use **Secret** for all integration keys/tokens. Do not put them in `wrangler.toml`, do not commit them to GitHub, and do not share them publicly.

Now **continue** the setup until you reach **Recommended Integrations**. The next integrations are **required** to make it all work properly, but the recommended ones will help you improve your experience a bit more.

### 3. Add game search and auto-fill

Game lookup requires integrating with IGDB.
IGDB authentication uses Twitch developer credentials:

1. Open the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).
2. Log in with a Twitch account.
3. Make sure the account has email verification and 2FA enabled.
4. Go to **Applications**.
5. Click **Register Your Application**.
6. Use any app name, for example `Gamelist`.
7. Use `http://localhost` as the OAuth Redirect URL.
8. Set the category to **Website Integration** or the closest available category.
9. Create the app.
10. Copy the **Client ID** and create a new **Cloudflare secret**:

```text
IGDB_CLIENT_ID
```

11. Copy the **app secret** and create another **secret**:

```text
IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 4. Set up the automatic website updates/patches

To receive upcoming Gamelist feature updates, add the GitHub Actions sync workflow to your repository.

1. Once the setup is done, go to your newly added GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Click **set up a workflow yourself**.
4. Make sure the default file name is:

```text
main.yml
```

5. Then open this link [main.yml](https://github.com/ShabiiEXE/Gamelist/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) to the workflow action file from the main Gamelist repository.
6. Copy the code from that file using to copy button on the top right or manually select all and copy.
7. Paste it into the empty workflow text box.
8. Commit the changes.
9. Go back to **Actions**.
10. Open **Sync from upstream**.
11. Enable the workflow if GitHub asks.
12. Click **Run workflow** once to test it.

To force an update manually later, open your repository, go to **Actions**, open **Sync from upstream**, and click **Run workflow**.
For now, let's finish this setup.

13. Open [GitHub fine-grained personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens).
14. Click **Generate new token**.
15. Use a clear name, for example `Gamelist Cloudflare updater`.
16. Under **Resource owner**, choose the GitHub account that owns your Gamelist repository.
17. Set **No expiration** as the expiration date.
18. Under **Repository access**, choose **Only select repositories**.
19. Select only your Gamelist repository. Do not select any other repositories.
20. Under **Repository permissions**, **Add permissions** and check **Actions** and change it to **Read and write**.
21. Click **Generate token**.
22. Copy the token immediately. GitHub will not show it again.
23. Add it in Cloudflare **Variables and Secrets** as a **Secret**:

```text
GITHUB_WORKFLOW_TOKEN
```

When you mark a game with a release date as preordered, the Worker can add an all-day Google Calendar event named `Preorder "Game Name"`.

1. Create a new Calendar in your Google Calendar.
2. Set up a [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) service account with Google Calendar API access, then share the target calendar with the service account email generated with permission to make changes.

3. Add the created service account email address as a Cloudflare **Variables and Secrets** entry:

```text
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

4. Add the `private_key` value from the service account JSON as another **secrets** entry:

```text
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
```

5. Add this service account email to your calendar and give it all the permissions.

6. Add the calendar ID from the calendar you are using as a **secrets** entry. You can get this from your calendar settings after:

### Import And Export CSV

Both pages have **CSV data** controls at the bottom of Settings, after Stores.

- **Export** downloads the current game rows as CSV.
- **Import** replaces the current game rows from a CSV after confirmation.
- Arrays and objects, such as owners, tags, store links, prices, and metadata, are preserved as JSON text inside CSV cells.

Use CSV export before any large bulk operation if you want a quick backup.
